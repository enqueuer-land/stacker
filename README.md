[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lopidio/stacker.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/lopidio/stacker)

Stacker is a desktop application with the sole purpose of create and display [enqueuer](https://github.com/lopidio/enqueuer)'s stuff;

Given that, Stacker and Enqueuer have to exchange information, Stacker:
- creates, saves and loads runnables;
- sends them to Enqueuer;
- receives back these runnables' reports;
- parses these reports; and
- displays them.
